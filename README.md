Hey there 👋,

My name id Raj Madhavapeddi. I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about php, python and data engineering. Apart from these I also work on various ecommerce web applications. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  I 💕 a good onboarding readme with good example.
